- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacuJack
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things, 
  from movies, gaming, and music to the most unusual random facts, 
  by the way, did you know that the elephant is the only
  terrestrial animal that can not jump, well now you know... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, I'm coursing a Bootcamp on JavaScript to become a FullStak Developer 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all types of projects, my final goal is to learn as much as possible 
- 📫 you can reach me via email at jjacubovsky@gmail.com
